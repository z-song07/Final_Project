    "The spotify API requires a client ID and client secret, which are unique identifiers for each user and are used to connect to the spotify developer API. These unique identifiers are used to create access tokens that grant users access to the spotify database. In the previous example using the New York Times API, I included the client ID and secret publicly in the notebook and uploaded it to Github, which is insecure and anyone can access the credentials to access the API. Some APIs are paid and contain confidential information, so in this project, I use a .env file to store my client ID and secret as environment variables and use the dotenv library to load the variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "The datasets we previously worked with in class were mostly organized and non-nested, making them easy to read and convert to Pandas DataFrames. However, when using the Spotify API, since Spotify uses a relational database to store their music information, instead of explicitly including all the information about albums, artists, and tracks in a playlist, they use ids to reference albums, artists, and tracks, which when retrieved become multiple levels of nested dictionaries and lists. I had to use the json_normalize() method to flatten the json data. I also had to write a custom function and then apply it to the artist column of the dataframe to get only the artist names."

    "Most of the challenges I faced were retrieving and cleaning the data. The music data in the Spotify API and the Billboard Hot 100 CSV does not contain too many numbers but is more of string information.The topic I want to further analyze the music data is comparing the number of streams for each song, and the sales of the album for each artist. However, the Spotify API removes the streaming data and instead uses a popularity index to rank the popularity of songs. In order to get more statistics about popularity, I will have to scrape data from the Billboard website in the future."
